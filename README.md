### What I learned
The main learning points for me was the use of CSS and Bootstrap, and mobile-responsiveness development. 

As someone who finds flexbox more intuitive, trying to learn the grid system as a "hacky" way of creating a mobile-friendly page was a challenge. Not to mention the fact that I am still relatively new to Bootstrap, I found myself frustrated at times over seemingly easy tasks.

A major learning point for me was the use of padding. Rather than relying on setting `height: 100%`, I realized the use of padding allows me to centralize elements equally well. In fact, when I used the attribute `height`, I encountered many problems getting my elements' height to stay consistent across multiple viewport widths. Specifically, I had issues sitting the image nicely in the card. These issues were ultimately solved with the use of padding and removing `height` attributes.

### Continued development

As this project is of newbie difficulty, and I struggled even with simple centering and managing Bootstrap grid system, I definitely have a long way to go with becoming more proficient with making **mobile-friendly websites** and using **Bootstrap** effectively. Thus, these are the 2 areas I will continue to focus on.
